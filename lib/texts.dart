      "The murmur of the pine’s green branches is in her ears, she remembers how the white heron came flying through the golden air and how they watched the sea and the morning together, and Sylvia wonders whether the stranger would think differently of the birds if he could only see what she had.",
      "As she recounts all the sights of the morning, the stranger listens with a patient excitement. Sylvia tells of the great tree, that glimmering sunlight on the waves, and the white heron nesting in that endless greenery. That narrowing of his eyes, that sudden flash of color in his cheeks might betray a certain eagerness, but Sylvia, too enthralled in narrating that most mystical scene, does not see it.",
      "“I must find it!” he finally exclaims after the child has finished explaining the way to the heron’s nest. “It would mean much if you would join me.”"

Grinning with delight at the thought of bringing home such a prize as the white heron, the young man leads her along the meadow path to woods, his steps quick with excitement. The child follows only a few steps behind, the man's soft whispers about the wondrous heron enrapturing her soul with a great awe.",
      "But as they venture deeper into the forest, closer to the heron’s nest, a deep sense of unease begins to gnaw at the child. All the wood around her is completely silent, as if every creature had suddenly decided to hold its breath. She remembers how the trees swayed that morning, directed by the melody of birds above. In place of that joyous song is now only a strange and unsettling quietude.",
      "The young man too, seems to sense something is amiss, for his eyes widen and slowly survey the greenery, trying to discern any sign of what could have disturbed the forest's peace. They both stand frozen in silence for a long while, but still the wood refuses to make any sound. Finally, without a word, the young man determines to continue the journey in silence. Sylvia follows, this queer stillness having stolen all her previous excitement.",

      "The child nestles against the trunk of that great tree, the familiar sounds of the forest all around her offering some solace, but also reminding her of the heron’s great peril. She stops to catch her breath, her thoughts confused. Is it too late to save the heron?",
      "In the forest, Sylvia feels a sense of belonging and safety that she had not felt in the presence of the hunter. The vastness of the woods and the company of the rustling leaves and singing birds offer her a sense of solace and comfort that she cannot find elsewhere. Against the hunter, she feels small and helpless, like a fragile bird facing a predator far more powerful than herself.",

He turns around, a small smile spreads across his face. “Good,” he says. “I could use your help.” And with that, they set off towards the heron's nest, their footsteps crunching in the grass as they go.",
